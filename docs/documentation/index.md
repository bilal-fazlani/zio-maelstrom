# Documentation

ZIO-Maelstrom is makes it easier to solve [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) challenges in [:simple-scala: Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) using [ZIO](https://zio.dev/)

[Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) is a series of distributed systems challenges brought to you by [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) in collaboration with [Kyle Kingsbury](https://aphyr.com/about), author of [Jepsen](https://jepsen.io/). It's a great way to learn distributed systems by writing your own.

The challenges are built on top of a platform called [:simple-github: Maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom). Maelstrom simulates network traffic using stdin and stdout of node processes.

ZIO-Maelstrom is a high level Scala driver for Maelstrom which abstracts away the low level details of the platform and let you focus on the challenges

!!! note "Other libraries"
    There is also an official Go library for Maelstrom called [:fontawesome-brands-golang: maelstrom-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/demo/go)

    There a java open-source library called [:fontawesome-brands-java: maelstrom-java](https://github.com/lant/maelstrom-java)

## Prerequisites

The first thing to do is to [download and setup](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/01-getting-ready/index.md#getting-ready) the Maelstrom CLI.

Since Maelstrom is Closure program, you will need JVM installed on your machine. You will also need graphviz & gnuplot.

```bash
brew install openjdk graphviz gnuplot
```

## Getting started

Create an sbt project with Scala 3 and add the following dependency:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.bilal-fazlani" %% "zio-maelstrom" % "0.1.1"
```
