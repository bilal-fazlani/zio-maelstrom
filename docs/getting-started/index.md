# Getting started

ZIO-Maelstrom is makes it easier to solve [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) challenges in [:simple-scala: Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) using [ZIO](https://zio.dev/)

[Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) is a series of distributed systems challenges by [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) in collaboration with [Kyle Kingsbury](https://aphyr.com/about), author of [Jepsen](https://jepsen.io/). It's a great way to learn distributed systems by writing your own.

The challenges are built on top of a platform called [:simple-github: Maelstrom](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom). Maelstrom simulates network traffic using stdin and stdout of node processes.

ZIO-Maelstrom is a high level Scala driver for Maelstrom which abstracts away the low level details of the platform and let you focus on the challenges

!!! note "Alternatives"
    Maelstrom has an official Go library called [:fontawesome-brands-golang: maelstrom-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/demo/go)

    There is also a java open-source library called [:fontawesome-brands-java: maelstrom-java](https://github.com/lant/maelstrom-java)

## Prerequisites

The first thing to do is to [download and setup](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/01-getting-ready/index.md#getting-ready) the Maelstrom CLI. It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/releases/latest)

Since Maelstrom is Closure program, you will need JVM installed on your machine. You will also need graphviz & gnuplot.

```bash
brew install openjdk graphviz gnuplot
```

## Installation

Create an sbt project with Scala 3 and add the following dependency:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.bilal-fazlani" %% "zio-maelstrom" % "0.1.1"
```

## Creating a node

A node is a process that can receive messages and respond to them. It can also send messages to other nodes. Take a look at [Challenge #1: Echo](https://fly.io/dist-sys/1/) to understand the basics of a node. This node is implemented in Go. You can find an equivalent implementation in Scala [here](echo.md)

## Running a node

Maelstrom requires a binary executable file to launch a node. There are several ways to create a binary executable file:

- Create a fat JAR using [sbt-assembly](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/sbt-fat-jar) plugin
- Create a fat JAR using [Coursier bootstrap](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-bootstrap)
- Create an OS native app using [sbt-native-image](https://github.com/scalameta/sbt-native-image) plugin

I have tested with Coursier bootstrap and it works well. But sbt-assembly should be even more simple to work with.

Once you have an executable file, you can run it using the Maelstrom CLI. 

```bash
./maelstrom test -w echo \ # (1)!
  --bin ./echo.jar \ # (2)!
  --node-count 1 \ # (3)!
  --time-limit 10 \ # (4)!
```

1.  `-w` is the workload. Each challenge may have a different workload
2.  `--bin` is the path to the executable file
3.  `--node-count` is the number of nodes to run
4.  `--time-limit` specifies the duration of simulation in seconds
