All given examples are from [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) - A series of distributed systems challenges by [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) in collaboration with [Kyle Kingsbury](https://aphyr.com/about), author of [Jepsen](https://jepsen.io/)

## Challenge #1: Echo

<div markdown="1" class="examples">

Get the hang of working with Maelstrom in Scala by creating a node which is a binary that receives JSON messages

[View Code](echo.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[View Challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/1/){ .md-button }

## Challenge #2: Unique ID Generation

Implement a globally-unique ID generation system that runs against Maelstrom's unique-ids workload 

[View Code](unique-ids.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[View Challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/2/){ .md-button }

## Challenge #3b: Multi-Node Broadcast

Implement a broadcast system that gossips messages between all nodes in the cluster. Gossiping is a common way 

[View Code](broadcast.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
[View Challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/3b/){ .md-button }
