- [ ] File input is not working
- [ ] Error code hierarchy needs to be simplified
- [ ] User messages should not be restricted to a msg_id of Int
- [ ] Create documentation
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Add more examples
- [ ] Multiple request-response can be started. There should be only one handler for a node
- [ ] Out messages should not need to define types. Use class name. May need to use macros
- [ ] If a message is awaited, and another callback is is being registered with same messages id from same remote, then it results in unintended behavior
  - [ ] Does this need to be solved in this library?
- [X] Make internal  types/apis private
- [X] Add concurrency in settings
- [X] Ask pattern
- [X] Use union and compound types for message hierarchy. IN messages don't need "type"
- [X] Separate init from receive messages
